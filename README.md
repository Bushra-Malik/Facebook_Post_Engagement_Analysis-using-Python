# Facebook Post Engagement Analysis for a Cosmetic Brand

This project explores the engagement patterns of a famous cosmetic brand's Facebook posts over the course of 2014. By analyzing the relationship between post types (photos, videos, status updates, and links) and key engagement metrics like likes, comments, and shares, we aim to determine which content performs best on the platform.

## Project Overview

The dataset includes detailed information on posts, such as:
- **Type of Post**: (e.g., photo, status, video, link)
- **Post Timing**: Date, day of the week, and hour of posting
- **Paid vs. Organic Posts**: Whether the post was boosted with paid promotion
- **Engagement Metrics**: Number of likes, comments, shares, and total interactions

### Objectives:
- Understand the factors that drive post engagement.
- Determine which types of posts attract the most attention.
- Offer insights into the best times and days for posting to maximize audience interaction.

## Key Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
   - Removing missing values and preparing the data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics and data visualization to identify trends and outliers.

3. **Engagement Metrics Calculation**:
   - Total and average interactions (likes, comments, shares) broken down by post type, paid status, and time of posting.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Evaluating the relationship between different engagement metrics to uncover key drivers of user interaction.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - Bar charts and line graphs to visually represent the engagement trends over time and by post type.

## Key Insights

- **Photo posts** drive the highest engagement, followed by video content.
- **Paid posts** tend to generate more interactions compared to organic (unpaid) posts.
- Posts published on **weekdays**, particularly in the afternoon, receive the most engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and exploration.
